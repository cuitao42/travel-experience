# 🇻🇳 Vietnam · 2025/08

## 📍 Overview

- **Visa**  
  - Apply directly through the official e-visa website (processing takes ~3 business days).  
  - No need for overpriced "express" services.  
  - **Chinese citizens**: e-visa must be exchanged for a separate paper visa upon entry (immigration stamps are placed on the paper visa, not the passport, to avoid issues with the “nine-dash line” map in newer passports).  
  - **Other nationalities**: may enter directly with e-visa.  

- **Climate & Health**  
  - Hot and humid—stay hydrated and avoid heatstroke.  
  - Public drinking fountains are rare (only spotted one near Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum).  
  - Tap water, even boiled, is not recommended—buy large bottled water (1 gallon) from supermarkets.  
  - Hanoi & Ha Long Bay: generally safe.  
  - Ho Chi Minh City & Nha Trang: crowded with tourists—beware of **bag snatchers / motorbike thieves** (wear phone lanyard, keep backpack in front).  

- **Prices & Cities**  
  - Ho Chi Minh City (largest) ≈ +25% vs. Hanoi; ≈ 2× Da Nang.  
  - Suggested route: **Ho Chi Minh → Da Nang → Hanoi**, then shop before departure (souvenirs cheaper in Hanoi).  

- **Language & Communication**  
  - Locals are friendly but most don’t speak English. Use **Google Translate**.  
  - Learn some basics:  
    - **Xin chào** = Hello  
    - **Cám ơn** = Thank you  
    - **Bao nhiêu** = How much?  
    - **Bến xe buýt** = Bus stop  
  - Still, even if you ask “How much?”, replies are usually in Vietnamese and hard to understand.  

- **Spending & Local Economy**  
  - Most local eateries/markets have no posted prices; foreigners often pay more.  
  - Choose shops/restaurants with displayed prices, or ask locals nearby.  
  - Median monthly income in 2025: **14.9M VND** (~$573–600 USD)—use as a reference for fair pricing.

- **Motorbike**: renting possible, but risky.  
- **Grab (ride-hailing)**: safer than taxis.  
  - Verify license plate matches the app.  
  - Ignore claims like “brother’s car” if plate doesn’t match.
